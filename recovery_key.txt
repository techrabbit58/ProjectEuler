Emergency Account Recovery Key

Your random key has been successfully generated and it is displayed below. The server only stores a hash of your key
in the database (using PHP's native password hashing algorithms), which means that once you navigate away from this
page it is not possible to display the key again.

It is your own responsibility to make a careful note of your emergency account recovery key before navigating away
from this page and to ensure that you keep it in a secure location. It is highly recommended that you also record the
date/time stamp as this information will be visible on your Account page and can be used to confirm that the key you
have is still active.

If you suspect that your key has been compromised then you can generate a new one, but please be aware that the
previous key will no longer work.
